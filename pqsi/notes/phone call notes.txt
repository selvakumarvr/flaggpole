1. Start doing sort
    - Tally Sheet
2. Barcode File

Part #, Quantity, Lot #, Serial #, Accepted, Rejected

  - Need a way to label part # with description and reuse that description in future

-----
When customer wants to start a new sort, Customer clicks on Add New Project.
Create new project based on old project (duplicate project)

That would send a PO and description of job.

Your people would go out to appropriate lots and they would scan the different bins:
  - Part #
  - Quantity
  - License Plate
  - Serial #
  - Date

Vendor
  - Normalized drop down menu

Create Chart Based On Their Excel Report
